# A Body-Powered Underactuated Prosthetic Finger Driven by MCP Joint Motion

## 🧠 Motivation

Partial finger amputations, particularly involving the loss of the PIP (proximal interphalangeal) and DIP (distal interphalangeal) joints, greatly diminish hand functionality—limiting grasping, pinching, and manipulation essential for daily life. 

While advanced prosthetic devices exist, many rely on electrically powered actuation systems that are expensive, bulky, and difficult to maintain, especially in pediatric or low-resource environments.

However, many amputees retain voluntary control of their MCP (metacarpophalangeal) joint. This presents a valuable opportunity to use residual biological motion to drive a prosthetic mechanism mechanically.

This project explores whether a single degree of freedom (1-DOF) actuation at the MCP joint can produce coordinated, underactuated movement in artificial PIP and DIP joints—restoring grasp function with only one joint input. If successful, the system offers a lightweight, cost-effective, and intuitive solution that enables natural interaction with everyday objects, without reliance on motors or batteries.
