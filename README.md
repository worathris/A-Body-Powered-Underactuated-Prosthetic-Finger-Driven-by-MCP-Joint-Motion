# Introduction to A-Body-Powered-Underactuated-Prosthetic-Finger-Driven-by-MCP-Joint-Motion

<img src="hardware/Fabricated finger.png"/>

This study presents the design, fabrication, and clinical validation of a lightweight, body-powered prosthetic index finger actuated via metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint motion. 
The proposed system incorporates an underactuated, cable-driven mechanism combining rigid and compliant elements to achieve passive adaptability and embodied intelligence, 
supporting intuitive user interaction. Results indicate that the prosthesis successfully mimics natural finger flexion and adapts effectively to a variety of grasp-ing tasks with minimal effort. 
This study was conducted in accordance with ethical standards and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB), 
Project No. 670161, titled ‚ÄúBiologically-Inspired Synthetic Finger: Design, Fabrication, and Application.‚Äù The findings suggest that the device offers a viable and practical solution for individu-als 
with partial hand loss, particularly in settings where electrically powered systems are unsuitable or inaccessible.
